# GenoGraphix Main Codebase

### Explore how GenoGraphix is transforming genetic analysis and diagnostics through innovative tools and accessible design.

## Our Mission

LAMP holds significant promise for rapid, on-site diagnostics due to its constant temperature operation. However, challenges such as primer self-amplification and primer dimers—where primers amplify themselves or bind to each other instead of the target DNA—reduce its reliability. Moreover, existing tools for selecting LAMP primers are often outdated and difficult to navigate.

GenoGraphix aims to address these challenges by developing a web-based application that enhances primer design, minimizes issues like self-amplification and primer dimers, and improves usability and reliability. Our platform is designed for both research and at-home diagnostics.
